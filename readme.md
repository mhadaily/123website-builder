* `$ npm start` will start the server
* `$ npm run start:debug` will start the server in debug mode (no error catchall, enable local service to use local file system as a storage)
* `$ npm run build` will build the client side code (html, css, js), ready for production
* `$ npm run build:server` this only check that the server scripts are correct
* `$ npm run watch:client` will watch the html, js and css source folders and rebuild when a file changes

### environment variables

* `SSL_PORT`, optional, default: to 443, [used here in the code]()
* `SILEX_FORCE_HTTPS`, optional [used here in the code](dist/server/server.js#102) to force https/ssl (default is `false`)
* `SILEX_SSL_PRIVATE_KEY`, optional (see ssl section bellow), [used here in the code](dist/server/server.js#L124)
* `SILEX_SSL_CERTIFICATE`, optional (see ssl section bellow), [used here in the code](dist/server/server.js#L124)

* `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` and `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`: optional, to activate github service, you need to create a github app to get these info ([create a github app](https://github.com/settings/applications/new) to get those)

### enable https / SSL

When you start Silex, it looks for the environment variables `SILEX_SSL_PRIVATE_KEY` and `SILEX_SSL_CERTIFICATE`. If they are present, it enables SSL.

`SILEX_SSL_PRIVATE_KEY` is expected to be the path to a `.key` file, and `SILEX_SSL_CERTIFICATE` the path to a  `.crt`.
